# Control protocol

How the apps and the web page talk to the server. There is no socket: each
runs the server in its own process and uses `ServerController` (in
`JetlinkKit/Sources/JetlinkServer`) directly.

| Who | How |
| --- | --- |
| Mac and iPhone apps | Swift calls: `handle(_:)` runs a `ControlCommand`, `events` delivers each `ControlEvent` |
| Android app | Each command as a JSON object through JNI (`Native.command`), a JSON reply back; the screens draw a snapshot built from the events |
| Web page (Jetson, PC) | Relays events to browsers as Server-Sent Events; a signed-in page sends some commands as JSON over HTTP |

It has no version number: every caller is built with the server it talks to.
The JSON below is what
`ControlEvent.jsonLine()` writes and the page streams: one object per line,
snake_case keys, sorted. An optional field with no value is left out, and a
reader takes a missing key as `null`; the examples below show such fields as
`<value>|null`.

## The web page

`jetlink-server --status-port P --web-auth FILE` (the installed service uses
5600 and `/etc/jetlink/web-auth.json`) serves a page to any browser on the
network. With the password file, everything but the page and the sign-in needs
the sign-in cookie; without it the page is read-only and the `/api/` controls
answer 403.

| Path | What |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /` | the page |
| `GET /api/session` | `{"auth": "none"\|"required", "signed_in"}`; renews a cookie over a day old |
| `POST /api/login` | `{"password"}`: sets the cookie, or 401; 429 with `retry_after` while held up |
| `POST /api/logout` | clears the cookie on this browser |
| `POST /api/logout-all` | a new signing key: every other browser signs in again |
| `POST /api/password` | `{"current", "new"}`: a new password and key, a new cookie for this browser |
| `GET /events` | Server-Sent Events: on connect the latest `hello`, `server`, `link`, `engine`, `inventory`, `catalog`, `download` and `benchmark`, the last two minutes of `stats`, then `host` and one `hw` a second while a page is open |
| `GET /logs` | the server's last 300 log lines, as text |
| `POST /api/command` | one of the [commands](#commands) below: `status`, `catalog`, `download`, `cancel_download`, `prepare`, `forget`, `inventory`, `benchmark`, `cancel_benchmark`; the reply's `ok` false is a 409 |
| `GET /api/system` | `settings`: the installer's answers that apply here, in its words; the version, keep-awake, the last run |
| `POST /api/settings` | `{"power": "always"\|"switched", "comma_poweroff": "yes"\|"no", "desktop": "on"\|"off", "autostart": "yes"\|"no"}`, only those that apply: runs `jetlink setup --set ...` |
| `POST /api/action` | `{"action": "restart"\|"reboot"\|"poweroff"\|"update"\|"check_update"\|"keep_awake", "seconds"}` |
| `GET /api/task` | the settings or update run: `kind`, `state` (`running`, `done`, `failed`, `lost`), `exit`, its last lines |

- **Cookie:** `jetlink_session`, HttpOnly, SameSite=Strict, 400 days. It is an
  expiry, a nonce and an HMAC-SHA256 under the file's key, so the server keeps
  nothing and a restart signs nobody out.
- **Password file:** root's, 0600: PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 (210,000 rounds) of the
  password, its salt, and the 32-byte signing key. The server reads it again
  when it changes. `jetlink-server web-password --file F [--generate]` writes
  one.
- **Guessing:** five tries an address, then a wait that doubles up to five
  minutes; two password checks a second at most from everyone together, one
  at a time.
- **Other sites:** a POST needs `Content-Type: application/json`, the header
  `X-Jetlink: 1` (no other site can send it without a preflight, which is never
  answered) and, when the browser sends one, an `Origin` naming this host.
- **Driving:** while the comma is connected and frames came in the last 10 s,
  `prepare`, `download`, `forget`, `benchmark`, settings, updates, restarts,
  reboots and power-off answer 409.
- **Runs:** settings and updates run the installer as the transient unit
  `jetlink-web-task` (`systemd-run`, nice 10), outside the server's own unit,
  since they restart it. Its output and exit status are in `/run/jetlink-web/`.
  Keep-awake is `jetlink caffeinate -t` as `jetlink-web-awake`, so it outlasts
  a restart too; Check for updates is `jetlink update --check`.

```bash
curl -c jar -H 'X-Jetlink: 1' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"password": "<password>"}' http://<name>.local:5600/api/login
curl -b jar -N http://<name>.local:5600/events
```

`host` (hostname, board, OS, kernel, GPU) and `hw` (CPU, memory, GPU,
temperatures, power, fan, disk) come from the Linux host; other hosts leave
them out.

`{"event": "<name>", "t": <unix time, float seconds>, ...}`. Placeholders in
angle brackets.

```jsonc

## Commands

`{"cmd": "<name>", ...arguments}`, answered by one reply:
`{"ok": true, ...extras}` or `{"ok": false, "error": "<sentence>"}`.

| cmd | arguments | reply extras | behaviour |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `status` | | | re-sends `server`, `link`, `engine`, `inventory`, `catalog` |
| `catalog` | `refresh` (default false) | `queued: true` | fetches the catalog if asked, or if the cache is missing or over an hour old, resolves missing pointers, then emits `catalog` |
| `download` | `ref` or `sha256` | `sha256` | queues a download (one at a time, in order); `download` events follow |
| `cancel_download` | `sha256` | | cancels it and removes the `.part` |
| `import` | `path` | `queued: true` | hashes and copies the file in; `import` events, then `inventory` |
| `prepare` | `sha256`, `frame_skip` (default 4) | `state`; `sha256` when downloading | builds if needed and loads it. With no model file or engine on disk it downloads first and replies `state: "downloading"` |
| `unload` | | | releases the loaded engine |
| `forget` | `sha256`, `artifacts` (default true), `model` (default false) | | unloads it if loaded, deletes its engines and/or download, then `inventory` |
| `inventory` | | | emits `inventory` |
| `benchmark` | `seconds` (default 60, up to 3600) | `queued: true` | runs the loaded model at the comma's pace with no comma; `benchmark` events. Refused while a comma is connected |
| `cancel_benchmark` | | | stops it |
| `shutdown` | | | emits `server` with `stopping`; the app stops the server |
