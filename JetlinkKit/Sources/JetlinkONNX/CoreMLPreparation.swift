///
/// 1. strip tinygrad's `org.tinygrad` layout ops;
/// 2. retype uint8 image inputs to fp16 and drop the head Cast, if any input is uint8;
/// 3. write negative constant Gather indices from the front;
/// 4. rewrite MatMul+Add as Gemm with a transposed weight (transB=1);
/// 5. rewrite repeat-only Expands as Tiles;
/// 6. for `.aneWhole` only (`layout='ane-whole'`), feed the policy's fp16
///    LayerNormalizations their input times 1/8 and run the heads after the
///    vision trunk in fp32;
/// 7. cut the graph where the vision trunk ends (`.split`, writing
///    vision.onnx and policy.onnx), or keep it whole (`.whole` and
///    `.aneWhole`, model.onnx);
/// 8. give each file a COREML_CACHE_KEY in its metadata_props.
///
/// `.plain` is TensorRT's preparation (`onnx_patch.patch_file`, what
/// trt/build.py parsed), and onnxruntime's CPU provider's: steps 1 and 2
/// only, the whole graph, no cache key. The other steps work around CoreML's
/// provider, which neither needs; the CPU provider on Android runs step 4's
/// transposed fp16 Gemm on one thread, a hundred times slower than MatMul.
///
/// `.liteRT` is none of the above but `Patches.forLiteRT`: the graph the
/// TFLite writer reads, written out as model.onnx so it can be checked
/// against the original on onnxruntime. The images stay uint8, there is no
/// cache key, and a frame queue's input and output take their 4-D shape.
///
/// The files are what Python's onnx.save writes for the same model: field
/// for field, and byte for byte on a model Python wrote.
///
/// Memory is the point, because an iPhone runs this. The source is
/// memory-mapped and only the graph's structure is decoded; each weight stays
/// a range of the mapped file until it is copied to the output. The
/// transposed Gemm weights, about 671 MB on the big models, and the fp32
/// head weights are made a few MB at a time while they are written. Every message's length is known
