///
/// Why reading ahead is safe. The comma pads every message to
/// `Wire.gadgetTxAlign` (16 KB) and writes it in whole multiples of 16 KB
/// (`StreamTransport.send`, `FfsTransport.write_chunk`), so it never sends a
/// short packet and every message ends on the stream's 16 KB grid. A 16 KB
/// read posted on that grid ends at a message's end or inside the message,
/// never past it: it cannot sit holding the end of one message while it waits
/// for bytes of the next. Bytes go to the reader in the order the reads were
/// posted, whatever order they are reaped in, and never more than it asks
/// for, so a message still lands whole at the start of its buffer.
///
/// A short packet takes the stream off the grid, which only a broken stream
/// does: the read fails, the session ends, and the comma reconnects. A
/// zero-length packet carries nothing and leaves the grid alone.
///
/// One reader at a time. Every call is made under `lock`, which the pipe also
/// holds when it calls `complete`, and releases while it waits.
