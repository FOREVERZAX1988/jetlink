/// - What this end sends keeps the one-byte PADDED rule, and goes out as one
///   transfer: libusb and IOUSBHost have no vectored bulk write, and several
///   writes let the host scheduler interleave them.
/// - Reads wait without a deadline, as the Python server's do between
///   messages; `shutdown()` aborts them. Writes give up after
///   `writeTimeout` without progress.
/// - After a protocol error nothing resynchronises the stream: the link is
///   latched desynced, and `drain` swallows what the comma is still sending
///   so its own frame timeout fires instead of a half-written message
///   blocking it.

/// arrays inside an INFER stay aligned, and the steady state allocates nothing.
