==> done. The owner, the one resident jetlink process on the comma, builds the
    USB gadget on its first step, for USB or iOS as Accelerator Link says, and
    binds it. The provisioning run is what it starts when there is work, and
    that exits.

    An owner or modeld that was already running still has the OLD package
    imported, and manager never respawns a process that exited on its own.
    Reboot the comma, or restart them yourself (get the pid first: pkill -f
    over ssh matches your own ssh command line and kills the session):

      pgrep -f "^openpilot.sunnypilot.jetlink_adapter$"

    Sanity check with the Jetson cabled up and its server running
    (the jetlink-server service, or jetlink run):

      ssh <comma> 'cat /sys/class/udc/*/state'      # want: configured
      ssh <jetson> 'lsusb -d 1209:0001'             # want: the gadget listed
